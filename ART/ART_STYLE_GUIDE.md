# Art Style Guide (placeholder-ready)

## Style
- Isometric 2:1 pixel ratio illusion (classic isometric look).
- Slightly exaggerated, readable silhouettes.
- Color coding:
  - Ferrous: cool gray
  - Non-ferrous: warm orange/brown (copper)
  - Plastic: bright saturated
  - Trash: dull mixed

## Readability rules
- Conveyors must clearly show direction (arrows/animated belt).
- Machine states:
  - Running: subtle animation
  - Blocked: blinking indicator at output
  - Stalled: warning icon + muted animation

## Sprite requirements
- Tiles: ground, borders, hazard stripes
- Machines: at least 1 idle frame + 2–4 anim frames (optional early)
- Items: small icons/sprites visible on belts
