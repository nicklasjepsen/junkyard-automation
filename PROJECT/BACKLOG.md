# Backlog (ordered)

## Core foundation
- Isometric grid + coordinate conversions
- Tile occupancy + build/clear
- Conveyor routing system
- Item entity model + movement
- Machine tick simulation
- Data-driven content loader

## Slice gameplay
- Delivery dock spawns scrap batches
- Storage building buffers items
- Seller/shipping dock consumes products for money/contracts
- Contract UI and state machine
- Overlays: throughput, blocked, full, jammed

## Quality & UX
- Placement ghost + rotate
- Undo/demolish
- Tooltips and inspector panels
- Save/load

## Post-slice
- Forecast system
- Suppliers

- Hazards
