# Definition of Done

A feature is "done" when:
1. Behavior is specified in design docs or a feature spec.
2. Implemented with data-driven config where applicable.
3. Has acceptance criteria + manual test steps.
4. No new warnings/errors on boot.
5. UI has tooltips/labels for player comprehension.
6. Performance: maintains target FPS in typical slice yard.
7. Save/load compatibility is either supported or explicitly versioned/guarded.
