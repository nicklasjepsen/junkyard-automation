# Game Vision — Junkyard Automation (2D Isometric)

## One-sentence pitch
Build an isometric automation yard that transforms unpredictable scrap into valuable standardized materials through smart sorting and processing.

## Player fantasy
"I turned a filthy, mixed junk pile into a clean, humming industrial pipeline."

## Pillars
1. **Messy Inputs, Clean Outputs**
   - Scrap arrives mixed and contaminated; the player designs systems to handle variability.
2. **Throughput Clarity**
   - Every slowdown has a visible cause: jam, contamination, power shortage, storage full, routing mistake.
3. **Forecasted Unpredictability**
   - Variability is signaled via supplier profiles + daily forecasts. Chaos is manageable.
4. **Compact, Dense Optimization**
   - Maps are modest; depth comes from smart layouts, routing, and upgrade decisions.

## Target platform & camera
- PC first.
- 2D isometric tile grid, zoom + rotate (optional: 4-direction view).

## Core loop (macro)
Day starts → choose supplier deliveries + accept contracts → run yard → fix bottlenecks → ship goods → earn money + research → upgrade.

## Tone & theme
Industrial but charming. Satisfying machines. Humor via item names and supplier descriptions.

## Audience reference points
Locomotion (routing), Factorio/Satisfactory (automation), RollerCoaster Tycoon (readability, isometric charm), city builders (growth + zoning vibe).

## Success criteria for vertical slice
- Player can build a working pipeline and feel improvement.
- At least 3 meaningful bottleneck types occur naturally.
- At least 2 upgrade choices materially change layouts.
