# Balance KPIs

Track these during playtests:
- Time to first working output: < 5 minutes
- Time to first contract completion: 8–12 minutes
- Common failure: storage full / blocked outputs (readable)
- Player should redesign at least once in slice
- Expected "aha" moment: using splitters + storage to stabilize flow

Suggested tick rates:
- Conveyor throughput: 1 item per tile per ~0.2–0.5s (tune)
- Machine processing: 1 item per 0.5–2s depending on tier
